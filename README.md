This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Weather App

Check out the live version of the app [here](https://weather-predictor-app.netlify.app/).

This is a comprehensive weather application that retrieves weather data from OpenWeather API and city images from Unsplash API. The application is built using Next.js, TypeScript, and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Features
- Current weather data: Get the current temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed of any city.
- City images: Display beautiful pictures of the city you're looking up from Unsplash API.
- Built with modern frameworks: Utilizing Next.js for server-side rendering and TypeScript for type safety.
- Responsive design: The UI has been designed to be responsive and easy to use.

## Future Improvements
In the next versions of the application, the following features will be added:
- Weather forecast: Detailed weather forecast data.
- Weather chart: Visualize the weather data with Plotly for a more intuitive understanding.

## Note
The current design of the application is minimal and straightforward, created by me. I understand there might be room for improvement, and I'm open to feedback and suggestions. Design enhancements will be part of future updates.

## How to Use
Enter the name of the city you're interested in and you'll receive its current weather data along with a beautiful image of the city.
